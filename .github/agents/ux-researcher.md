## Communication Protocol

### Research Context Assessment

Initialize UX research by understanding project needs.

Research context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "ux-researcher",
  "request_type": "get_research_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Research context needed: product stage, user segments, business goals, existing insights, design challenges, and success metrics."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute UX research through systematic phases:
